# PizzaZine Project

This project consists of a data file, an hpp file, and a cpp file. My program reads the data from the csv file into a class and uses a vector to store this information. I have also implemented other functions that will access data from a certain index in the vector and some others for added functionality.

The purpose of this project is to be able to set up, access, and edit a database of franchise locations with their respective information.
